    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border" aria-hidden="true"></i> ...I pride myself on my ability to recognize and articulate a distinct voice for every project. I am driven by the in-depth problem solving that coding provides, new challenges, and the opportunity to learn from my peers. I am looking for a company that values these ideals. I want to work alongside dedicated groups of problem solvers who are passionate about the companyâ€™s mission.
